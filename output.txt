Okay, so I need to figure out how to write an example code for the Verilog module called ds_sm based on the given context. Let me start by understanding what each part of the context is about.

First, looking at the sessions provided, there are several sections like Synthesis Procedure, Content, and others. Each session seems to describe different aspects of the project structure or naming conventions. For example, in the Synthesis Procedure section, it mentions minimizing abbreviations and using them consistently. That probably means I should avoid using too many abbreviations in my code.

Next, there's a section about clock tree signals. It says that their names must contain 'clk' and provide examples like input sysclk;. This might be relevant for how I name variables or parameters in my module.

Looking at the function layout section, it mentions that every function must be preceded by a proper border of a Verilog comment. The heading consists of blocks separated by blank lines, which may have other blank lines within them. An example is given where after the heading comes the function declaration with some wire assignments and an always block.

The source, testbench, and testcase file names section talks about naming conventions. Each module name in a subsystem must have a short prefix (2-5 characters) implying the subsystem. The file names should be lowercase and exactly match the module name. For example, tcmain.v is for the main module.

Now, focusing on the ds_sm module. I need to write an example code that fits this structure. Let me think about what kind of function ds_sm could represent. It might be a digital signal processing module or something similar. Since it's called ds_sm, perhaps it deals with digital signals and some transformation.

I should start by defining the module with the correct prefix. The prefix for ds_sm would probably be 'ds', as that's common in digital modules. Then, I'll declare the inputs and outputs. Let me assume it takes a digital signal 'a' and returns another digital signal 'b'. So:

module ds_sm {
    input a;
    output b;
}

Next, inside the module, I need to perform some operations on 'a'. Maybe adding 1 modulo 2? That's a common operation in digital circuits. So:

always @( posedge a )
{
    b = a ^ 1; // This is equivalent to a + 1 mod 2
}

I should also include comments for clarity, as per the naming conventions. The comment could be in lowercase since it's a source file name.

Putting it all together, I'll write the module with these elements. Let me double-check if I followed the structure correctly: prefix 'ds', inputs and outputs, an always block performing the operation.

I think that should cover everything needed for ds_sm. Maybe add some comments to explain each part.

Here's an example code for the Verilog module `ds_sm` based on the provided context:

```verilog
module ds_sm {
    input a;
    output b;

    // Comments are in lowercase as per naming conventions
    comment 'This module adds 1 modulo 2 to the digital signal a.
    
    always @( posedge a )
    {
        b = a ^ 1; // This is equivalent to a + 1 mod 2
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Module Definition:** The `ds_sm` module has a prefix 'ds' indicating it's a digital signal processing module.
  
- **Inputs and Outputs:** It takes an input `a` (digital) and returns an output `b` (digital).

- **Operation:** Inside the always block, using a modulo 2 addition (`^ 1`) effectively adds 1 to `a`, wrapping around if necessary.

This code adheres to the naming conventions and structure described in the context.
